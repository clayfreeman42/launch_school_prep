Declare a variable - initialize - a statement:
let a;

Statements don't return values

Initialize a variable - an expression:
a = 'foo';

Expression return a value

In a declaration, = is just a syntactic token:
let a = 'foo';

In an assigment, = is an assignment operator
a = 'bar'

Variables are not deeply linked:
let a = 4
let b = a
a = 7
// b will still equal 4!

Replace magic number with constants and use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
const INTEREST_RATE = 0.07;

Const declarations require a value

if {} are a block, function {} are not technically a block but can be treated as such

var does not use block scoping, let and const do

Undeclared variables have global scope!
p = 'foo';
